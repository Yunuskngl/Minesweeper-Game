# Minesweeper-Game
Hello Everyone, I basically made a minesweeper game. After running the program, you can start the game with the outputs. It works in the same logic as the classic Minesweeper game. You will see an 8x8 table and you will try to reach the result by opening the boxes other than mines with the values you entered.
